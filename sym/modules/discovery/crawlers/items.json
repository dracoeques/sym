    "summary": "The addition of realtime support to Linux, which started in 2004, is nearing completion, according to Thomas Gleixner, who spoke at the 2023 Linux Plumbers Conference. The aim of realtime preemption is to ensure that the highest-priority process can run with minimal and predictable delay. The only major issue left to be solved is with printk(), a function for sending messages to system consoles and logs. The function is currently fully synchronous, which introduces latency and contradicts the goals of the realtime work. Efforts to fix the printk() problem have been ongoing since 2018, with three final patch sets currently being developed.\n",

    "summary": "The article discusses how a company saved $230,000 per year by moving its infrastructure from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to a bare-metal solution. The transition gave the company more control over their resources and improved service reliability and customer communication. Initially, the company used a Kubernetes cluster on AWS for their open-source observability platform, OneUptime. However, they realized the benefits of AWS could be achieved at a lower cost elsewhere. The company then decided to run a Microk8s cluster in a colocation facility, which gave them dedicated resources and eliminated the 'noisy neighbor' issue often experienced in shared hosting environments. The move to bare-metal servers allowed them to customize their infrastructure to meet their specific needs.",

The exploit was used to steal email data, user credentials, and authentication tokens. Four different groups were observed exploiting the bug, with most activity occurring after the initial fix was made public on Github. Zimbra patched the vulnerability in July 2023. However, three groups began exploiting the vulnerability after the hotfix was made public, emphasizing the importance of applying fixes promptly. The initial discovery of the 0-day vulnerability was a campaign targeting a government organization in Greece. Other campaigns targeted government organizations in Moldova and Tunisia. TAG recommends keeping software fully updated and applying security updates as soon as they become available.\n",

The author concludes that until a new mechanism is developed, they will continue to use the __FILE__ macro, despite its downsides. The irony is that std::source_location provides information known only at compile time, but its current specification and implementation do not allow full utilization of that information at compile time.",

While CRDTs are useful for offline-first applications and text editing due to their ability to avoid overwriting changes and handle high rates of edits, they also have drawbacks. These include an ever-growing state due to the need to record both existing and deleted data, complex implementations which often lock users into specific technologies, and an opaque state which can be difficult to inspect or store. The author suggests alternatives to CRDTs for collaboration, such as contextual information, locking for safety, small-scale updates, and real-time fan-out of updates.",

    "summary": "Researchers at the University of Cambridge have developed a solar-powered device that can convert contaminated water or seawater into clean hydrogen fuel and purified water. The device, which is inspired by photosynthesis, can operate from polluted or seawater sources and produce clean drinking water simultaneously. The device uses a nanostructured carbon mesh to create water vapour for hydrogen production, while the rest of the light in the solar spectrum is used to vaporise the water. This innovation could be beneficial in resource-limited or off-grid environments and could help address the energy and water crises in many parts of the world.",

The process involves designing a Federated Learning pipeline with Flower for keyword spotting classification using a pre-trained Whisper encoder. The model classifies 1-second audio waveforms into one of twelve possible classes. The example also benchmarks the new Raspberry Pi 5, showing superior performance across tasks compared to the previous Raspberry Pi 4. The keyword spotting model can classify unseen keywords with an accuracy of over 97% after a few rounds of training.\n",

Signal is also working on adding quantum resistance to its protocol and has developed metadata protection technologies to secure personal details.

The author explains that while planned work is scheduled and organized, unplanned work, such as bug reports or feature requests, can appear randomly. The post emphasizes the importance of preparing for such unexpected tasks and outlines the challenges associated with them. Unplanned work is divided into two phases: intake and execution, each with its own unique challenges. The intake phase involves the reporting of unplanned work, which can be difficult due to the various channels through which issues can be reported. The execution phase involves resolving these reported issues, which can be complicated due to unclear responsibilities and priorities. The author further discusses the importance of a smooth intake process, suggesting it allows for better tracking and management of issues.",

In a five-part article series, the author plans to show how common performance bottlenecks can be eliminated through query optimization, index tuning, partitioning, database server tuning, and the use of read-only replicas.

    "title": "Smart drugs reduce quality of effort, and slow decision-making",
    "summary": "A new study conducted by the University of Melbourne found that 'smart drugs', used by many students as cognitive enhancers, actually reduce the quality of effort and increase the time taken to complete a decision-making task in cognitively healthy people. The study involved 40 healthy participants aged 18-35, who were given a problem-solving task known as the 'knapsack optimisation problem'. Each participant was given a different identical-looking white pill containing either a dose of Ritalin, modafinil, dextroamphetamine or a placebo. The results showed that the drugs did not affect the chance of a participant finding the solution, but participants tended to perform worse after taking one of the drugs, and spent substantially more time working on their solution. The drugs also increased the number of times the participants moved items in and out of the knapsack, but did not increase 'effort quality' or productivity.\n",

    "title": "A failed AI girlfriend product, and my lessons",
    "summary": "The author developed an AI friend product, Dolores, inspired by the GPT-4 capabilities and the Stanford\u2019s Western Town paper. Dolores is an iOS app that provides a template character setting, allowing users to chat with different characters. The author initially designed it to be consistent with the original Stanford paper, but this resulted in long response times and dialogues. To fix this, he reduced the frequency of reflection and the length of dialogue memory. The app was launched without sufficient testing due to high daily API costs. The author discovered that users demand realistic voices and that AI friend products have long usage times. Despite the high cost of realistic voice synthesis, 70% of Dolores' users in June chose this option.",
